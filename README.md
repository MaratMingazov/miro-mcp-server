# Miro MCP Server

## Overview

**Miro MCP Server** is an implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) that integrates with [Miro's REST API](https://developers.miro.com/docs/miro-rest-api-introduction). It enables AI systems to collaborate with users directly on Miro boards by interacting with board widgets. This server provides tools that AI models can use to build visual diagrams and perform real-time collaboration.

## Use Cases

- **Board Collaboration**: Automating collaboration on Miro boards.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the current state of a Miro board and extract useful information from visual layouts.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Use large language models to assist with structured diagram creation, brainstorming, and visual task planning using the MCP protocol.

## Installation

You can either download a precompiled JAR file from the [Releases](https://github.com/MaratMingazov/miro-mcp-server/releases) page or build the project yourself.

### Option 1: Use prebuilt JAR

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/MaratMingazov/miro-mcp-server/releases) page.
2. Place the `.jar` file in a desired location.

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaratMingazov/miro-mcp-server.git
cd miro-mcp-server
./gradlew build
```

The resulting `.jar` file will be located in `build/libs/miro-mcp-server-1.0.jar`.

## Connecting the MCP Server

If you are using the [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) app with MacOS or Linux, you can find the configuration file at:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```        
Add the following configuration to your file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Miro-mcp-server": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-jar",
        "/path/to/miro-mcp-server-1.0.jar",
        "--token=miroToken"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/miro-mcp-server-1.0.jar` with the actual path to your `.jar` file and replace `miroToken` with your personal access token from Miro.

You can generate a personal access token by following [this guide](https://developers.miro.com/docs/miro-rest-api-introduction#authorization).

## Tools

### Items

- **getWidgets** - Get the widgets on a miro board
    - `boardKey`: Miro board key to get widgets

### Sticky Notes

- **createSticky** - Create a sticky note widget (sticker) on a miro board

    - `boardKey`: Miro board key to get widgets
    - `stickyNoteText`: The text to be displayed on the sticker
    - `x`: Sticker position x coordinate
    - `y`: Sticker position y coordinate
    - `width`: Sticker width
    - `fillColor`: Sticker fill color

### Connectors

- **createConnector** - Create a connector (line) widget between 2 specified widgets

    - `boardKey`: Miro board key to get widgets
    - `firstWidgetId`: First widget id for connector
    - `secondWidgetId`: Second widget id for connector
    - `connectorText`: The text to be displayed on connector

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a sample prompt you can use to instruct Claude or another LLM agent to interact with Miro board:

```
I want you to create a simple diagram on a Miro board.
Please follow the next steps:
1 - Create a sticky note with some text.
2 - Create the second sticky with a different text.
3 - Now create a line between the two sticky notes using the id's of previously created stickers.
```
